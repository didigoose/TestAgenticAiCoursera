# GAME framework
The GAME framework provides a structured way to design AI agents, ensuring modularity and adaptability. It breaks agent design into four essential components:

G - Goals / Instructions: What the agent is trying to accomplish and its instructions on how to try to achieve its goals.
A - Actions: The tools the agent can use to achieve its goals.
M - Memory: How the agent retains information across interactions, which determines what information it will have available in each iteration of the agent loop.
E - Environment: The agentâ€™s interface to the external world where it executes actions and gets feedback on the results of those actions.
